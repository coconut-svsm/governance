# COCONUT-SVSM Technical Steering Committee (TSC)

## Overview

The Technical Steering Committee (TSC) provides technical guidance and oversight for the COCONUT-SVSM project. The TSC makes strategic and technical decisions for the project, distributes project maintenance to increase the project's "bus factor", and provides support with pull request reviews and testing.

## Members

- **Jörg Rödel** (Chair)
- **Jon Lange**
- **Peter Fang**
- **Stefano Garzarella**

All TSC members have write access to the repositories.

## Responsibilities

### Active Governance (Core SVSM Repository)

For the main [SVSM repository](https://github.com/coconut-svsm/svsm), the TSC provides active governance:

- Reviewing and approving pull requests (at least one TSC member approval required before merging)
- Supporting testing efforts and maintaining code quality standards
- Making strategic and technical decisions that shape the direction of the project

### Ecosystem Oversight (All Repositories)

For all repositories within the [COCONUT-SVSM organization](https://github.com/coconut-svsm/), the TSC provides oversight:

- Admin access to all repositories to ensure long-term continuity and security
- Non-interventional observation, only stepping in when significant issues arise (security vulnerabilities, maintainer inactivity, or irreconcilable disputes)
- Full details on repository governance can be found in the [Repository Governance Policy](../Policies/repositories.md)

### Community Standards

- Discussing and handling Code of Conduct matters to ensure a healthy community environment across all project spaces

## Decision Making

The TSC makes decisions through discussions and voting:

- TSC members may vote **yes** to support a proposal, **abstain** to indicate neutrality, or vote **no** to oppose it
- A **no** vote constitutes a veto, blocking the proposal from moving forward
- The TSC chair retains the authority to override a veto in exceptional circumstances when deemed necessary for the project's best interests

## Communication

The primary communication channel for the TSC and the broader COCONUT-SVSM community is the mailing list:

- **Address**: coconut-svsm@lists.linux.dev
- **Archive**: https://lore.kernel.org/coconut-svsm/

Technical discussions and decisions are also tracked through GitHub:

- **Issues**: https://github.com/coconut-svsm/svsm/issues
- **Pull Requests**: https://github.com/coconut-svsm/svsm/pulls

The TSC holds regular development calls scheduled via the mailing list. During these calls, the TSC will briefly summarize what was discussed in the latest TSC meeting. Meeting minutes are published to the governance repository:

## Code of Conduct

All TSC members must adhere to the project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/coconut-svsm/svsm/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), setting an example for the community and ensuring a respectful, inclusive environment.
