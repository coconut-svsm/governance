## Topics:

### Discussion on SVSMs role in mitigating [Ahoi](https://ahoi-attacks.github.io/)-Attacks against SEV-SNP:

* Adam Dunlap inquired about plans to use SVSM to mitigate Ahoi attacks
* Requires the SVSM running with restricted injection and injecting IRQs to OS via alternate injection
  * Also some amount of APIC emulation required in SVSM
* Joerg Roedel presented the challenges of implementing VMPLs (Virtual Machine Privilege Levels) in the KVM hypervisor
  * There are three technologies which would benefit from a common interface: VSM, VMPLs, and TDX-Partitioning
  * Current proposal for implementing VSM not ideal for VMPLs and might not work at all for TDX-Partitioning
  * Need to engage with KVM maintainers on a better solution
* Current prototype implementation of VMPLs in KVM uses single IRQ source for all VMPLs
* Other hypervisors implement one source per VMPL
* Need to be resolved for KVM before SVSM can make progress on this
* Joerg Roedel mentioned that restricted injection will be required for SVSM to mitigate vulnerabilities.

### Merging TDX Changes into Linux and QEMU repositories:

* Vijay dhanraj proposed merging his changes related to TDX partitioning with the COCONUT Linux and QEMU code-base.
* Joerg Roedel agreed to merge it into a separate branch until SVSM gets TDX support.
* Joerg Roedel will test changes on SEV-SNP.

### User Space Support Code for SVSM:

* Joerg Roedel provided an update on his progress in developing user space support code modules for the SVSM.
  * Currently working on user-space memory allocator

### Microsoft TPM Implementation:
* Joerg Roedel discussed the decision to maintain a separate repository for the Microsoft TPM implementation due to the challenges of upstreaming changes to the MSTPM library.

### Memory Fault Issue:
* Cl치udio Carvalho brought up a recently reported memory fault issue and Roy Hopkins volunteered to investigate it.

### Microsoft TPM debug flags:
* Cl치udio Carvalho addressed challenges encountered when using different optimization flags for the Microsoft TPM code in debug and release builds.
* Joerg Roedel suggested enabling SSE instructions in the Coconut SVSM as a sustainable solution.
* Cl치udio Carvalho will open an issue to track progress on this

### Next Meeting:
* The next development call will be held in two weeks.
