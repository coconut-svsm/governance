COCONUT-SVSM Policy on Submissions of AI-Generated Code
=======================================================

# Scope and Applicability

This policy governs the submission of code contributions to the COCONUT-SVSM
project, including instances where **Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools** were
used in the code generation process. This policy applies to all **Pull Requests
(PRs)** submitted for inclusion in the project's codebase, spanning all
repositories under the COCONUT-SVSM GitHub organization.

# Acceptability of AI-Generated Code

AI-generated code is **acceptable** under the following mandatory conditions:

* **Human Responsibility:** A human contributor must be the official submitter
  of the code. This individual takes **full responsibility** for the code's
  content, quality, and adherence to project standards.
* **Quality and Functionality:** The submitter must ensure that the
  AI-generated code **works correctly** and meets all established **quality and
  functional requirements** of the project.
* **Licensing and Compliance:** The submitter is responsible for ensuring that
  the code, regardless of its origin, **fully complies with all project
  licensing requirements** and does not introduce any intellectual property or
  licensing conflicts.

# Submission Requirements

## Submitter Identification

Pull Requests (PRs) must be submitted by a **human** being. PRs generated
entirely by a AI agents are not acceptable. The COCONUT-SVSM Technical Steering
Committee can allow exceptions to this rule on a case-by-case basis.

## 3.2. Disclosure and Tagging

* **No Mandatory Disclosure:** Contributors are **not required** to disclose
  whether a submitted piece of code was generated with the assistance of an AI
  tool.
* **No Special Tags:** The project **will not require or use special commit
  tags** to identify AI-generated code.

# Merge Decision Requirements

While AI tools are permitted in the submission and review process, the final
authority for integrating code into the project rests solely with human
contributors.

* **AI Assistance in Review:** AI tooling is explicitly allowed to assist in
  the code review process, including tasks such as suggesting improvements,
  identifying potential bugs, or checking style compliance.
* **Human Final Decision:** The final merge decision for any Pull Request (PR)
  must be made by a human reviewer or maintainer. AI tools or automated agents
  are not permitted to execute the final merge operation or act as the sole
  approver. This ensures a human is accountable for the integrity of the
  project's codebase.

# Exclusion of Automated Tools

Automated tools, such as **Dependabot**, which perform routine tasks like
updating dependencies but do **not generate or alter core functional code**,
are **not considered AI agents** under the scope of this policy. Their
submissions, where applicable, will continue to be handled under standard
project procedures.
